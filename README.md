# cs411-doggr (Fall 2016)

Doggr is a CS411 Group Project created by the following members:

Ash K., Jasmine K., Ivy L., Kirsten W.

It is an application that matches users with specific dog breeds. The breeds are ranked according to user preferences, such as:

Child-friendliness
Amount of exercise
Size of dog
The user can filter through the dog breeds by these preference filters.

In addition to matching, users can also look up shelter dogs of a specific breed. This application is narrowed to the state of Illinois. Unfortunately, the Google Distance API does not work when this project was transferred from the UIUC's virtual machine to Heroku's server, but the original code is attached in a file called "rec2.py" in this github repository. (The Google API is used to calculate and rank the shelter dogs by shortest distance according to the user's inputted city).
